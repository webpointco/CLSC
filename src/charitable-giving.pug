        p The <strong>Chinese Language School of Columbia (CLSC)</strong> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, apolitical organization that is led by a group of community volunteers, including parents of students who matriculate in the school. Volunteers hold distinct positions such as Principal, Academic Dean, the Board of Directors (BoD), and a separate Board of Trustees (BoT), who oversee activities of the BoD.
        p.pt-5 The ability of CLSC to carry its mission is completely dependent on tuition revenue, volunteer efforts from the school community and the gracious support of donors. We hope you will support our mission by donating to our school today.
